# kevinbacran: Degrees of Separation Between CRAN authors

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/FltCW7GUbF5iE/giphy.gif)

_This package is in development._

How separated are authors on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), the home of R packages?

The aim is to provide some functions to approximate an implementation of [The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon), or [Erdos Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) and [variants(https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/whats-your-erdos-bacon-sabbath-number).

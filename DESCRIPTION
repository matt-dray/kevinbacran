Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Matt",
           family = "Dray",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "mwdray@gmail.com")
Description: Calculate the shortest path through a graph network between any two 
    authors listed on CRAN. Analagous to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or Erdos
    Number. Author X collaborates with author Y; author Z collaborates with Y
    but not X, therefore the distance from X to Z is two.
